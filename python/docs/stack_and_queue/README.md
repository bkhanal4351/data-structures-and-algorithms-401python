# Stacks and Queues
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

## Challenge
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
I approached the challenge, by writing functions to implmenent below requested featues. Ran test after each mehod was implmeneted, followed the errors and fixed it one at a time.

Features:
 Stack:
 1. Push
 2. Pop
 3. Peek
 4. is empty

 Queue:
 1. enqueue
 2. dequeue
 3. peek
 4. is empty

Big 0
 Time and space is constant as it only performs one method at a time whether it push or pop or peek.

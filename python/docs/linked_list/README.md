## Challenge
. Create a Node class that has propertis for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
. Create a linked list class that includes head and upon instantiation, an emplty Linked list should be created
. LinkedList class should contain
  . insert
  .includes
  .to string

## Approach & Efficiency
I followed the instruction provided and ran one test at a time.
I read through the errors for each failed test and implemented the fix.
Big 0 for insert
  - Time: O(n) - As linked list are not contiguous and each iteration occurs only once.
  - Space: O(1) - Since we are only using memory/space for one value.
